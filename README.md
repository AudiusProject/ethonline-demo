**Audius HTTP API**

**Audius Libs (JS)**
(read + write)

This is our main js package that we use in our clients to connect to the chain, manage wallets, write content to backends. The docs are sparse as it stands, so we're happy to lend a hand!

`npm install @audius/libs`

<br />

**Audius.js (JS)**
(read + write)

A thin wrapper around `@audius/libs` that surfaces some of our internal streaming technology (HLS).

Our community-driven Discord bot uses this abstraction.

`npm install @audius/audius.js`

**Component Library (under development)**

Stems is our audio-forward React component library under development.

As it stands, there are only a few components (Buttons, Modals, Poups), but it includes our fonts & color palettes if you'd like to hack in style üòé.
